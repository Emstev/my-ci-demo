# Simple CI Demo â€” GitHub Actions

This repo demonstrates a beginner-friendly CI workflow:
- Runs unit tests on every PR and push.
- On push to `main`, creates a GitHub Release with a packaged app zip.

## Quick local test
1. Install deps:
   ```bash
   npm ci

2. Run tests:
   
    npm test

4. Run app locally:
   
    npm start
# then open http://localhost:3000/ and /health
